# Subject

Modeling and characterization of pseudorandom number generators.

# Description

Write a C# application for modeling pseudorandom number generators using
64-bit unsigned integer arithmetic:

1. Generator based on the Lehmer’s algorithm.

2. Generator based on the middle-product method.

3. Generator based on the linear feedback shift register.

Select the parameters for the generators in order to get the best results
for each generator (for samples $N = 10\ 000, 500\ 000, 100\ 000\ 000$).

Output the histogram, expectation, variation and results of the № 1–8 NIST
tests for the best case.

Compare the obtained results with the built-in C# generator.
